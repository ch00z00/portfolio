  "I began studying IT around my 2nd year of university, and for about 2 years from that point, I worked as a long-term intern as a front-end engineer at a domestic IT startup company in Japan. However, during my time there, I had a moment of reflection about my own market value in the industry. So, I decided to temporarily part ways with the company and contemplated my worth as an engineer. During this period of introspection, I stumbled upon Kenta Toshikura's portfolio website, where I was drawn to the sophisticated design and development of websites incorporating 3D elements and clever design choices. Simultaneously, I found clues to discover my own market value. Since then, I have aspired to become an engineer capable of creating exceptional websites akin to those found overseas.";

  "私は大学2年生頃からITを学び始め、同年から2年ほど日本国内のITベンチャー企業で長期インターン生のフロントエンドエンジニアとして働きました。しかし、そこで働く中で、業界における自身の市場価値について考えるきっかけがありました。そこで一度某企業を離れ、エンジニアとしての存在価値を考えました。その最中に利倉健太さんのポートフォリオサイトに出会い、3D表現や巧みなデザインを駆使した洗練されたウェブサイトのデザイン・開発に惹かれ始めました。それと同時に、自分の市場価値を見出すヒントを得ました。それから私は海外のサイトのような優れたウェブサイトを生み出せるエンジニアになりたいと思うようになりました。";
